# üå§Ô∏è IoT Atmospheric Sensor Using BMP280 and ESP32

## üìò Project Overview
This project demonstrates the development of a simple **IoT-based environmental monitoring system** using an **ESP32 microcontroller** and a **BMP280 sensor**.  
The BMP280 measures **temperature**, **pressure**, and **altitude**, while the ESP32 reads, processes, and sends the data to the cloud for real-time visualization on a dashboard.  
The primary goal is to understand how sensors communicate with microcontrollers via the **I¬≤C protocol** and how to transmit environmental data accurately using IoT technologies.

## üéØ Objectives
- Interface the **BMP280** sensor with an **ESP32** using **MicroPython**.  
- Read and analyze **temperature**, **pressure**, and **altitude** data.  
- Understand and apply the **I¬≤C communication protocol**.  
- Program and upload scripts using **Thonny IDE**.  
- Calculate **altitude** from atmospheric pressure readings.  
- Use the **MQTT protocol** for efficient IoT data transmission.  
- Connect the ESP32 to **ThingsBoard Cloud** for real-time data visualization.  
- Demonstrate real-world applications like **weather monitoring** and **drone altitude tracking**.

## üöÄ Setup and Configuration

1. Flash your **ESP32** with **MicroPython firmware**.  
2. Open **Thonny IDE** and connect to your ESP32 board.  
3. Upload the `bmp280.py` driver file to your ESP32.  
4. Create a new file named `main.py` and update the configuration below:

   ```python
   # Wi-Fi Credentials
   WIFI_SSID = 'Your_WiFi_Name'
   WIFI_PASSWORD = 'Your_WiFi_Password'

   # MQTT Configuration
   MQTT_BROKER = "test.mosquitto.org"   # Public MQTT broker
   MQTT_PORT   = 1883                   # Default MQTT port
   CLIENT_ID   = b"YourClientID"
   TOPIC       = b"YourTopic"

## How It Works
1. The ESP32 initializes communication with the BMP280 sensor over the I¬≤C protocol.
2. The BMP280 measures the barometric pressure and temperature of the environment.
3. Using these readings, it estimates altitude based on the barometric formula.
4. Random values (10‚Äì20) every 5 seconds.
5. Those datas publish to ThingsBoard dashboards via **MQTT**.
